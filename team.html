<h2>Our Collaboration</h2>
<p>Team Nova follows a real-world development workflow using Git and GitHub:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each member works on their own branch</li>
    <li>Pull requests are reviewed before merging</li>
    <li>No direct pushes to the main branch</li>
    <li> Team members contribute to commit history and documentation</li>
    <li>Merge conflicts are resolved together as a learning experience</li>
</ul>

<p>This project gave us a hands-on experience in teamwork, communication, and frontend development - skills we will apply in real client and professional environments.</p>
