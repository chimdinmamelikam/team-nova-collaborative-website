## ASIKE SANDRA - What I Learned
Before this project, I assumed that working on my terminal and using Git for version control would make collaboration seamless. However, this project taught me that successful collaboration requires **patience, clear communication, and careful planning**.  

Key takeaways include:  
- The importance of using **classes and IDs** properly in HTML and CSS to avoid conflicts  
- Planning CSS selectors carefully across developers prevents merge conflicts  
- Bootstrap is a powerful tool that simplifies styling challenges  
- True teamwork is about coordinating changes and respecting each developer's workflow  

This project reinforced that collaboration is not just about coding—it’s about strategy, foresight, and coordination.
